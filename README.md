Hypotheses to be explored:
1) House prices increase with larger living areas
2) Houses with better conditions have higher median prices than lower condition ones.
3) Waterfront houses have higher average prices than non-waterfront homes
-Other questions to be explored: 
4) Is there any significant relationship between house prices and building years? Newer houses are priced higher than older houses?

6) What is the overall average house price in the dataset?
